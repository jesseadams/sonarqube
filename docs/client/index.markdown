# Client Api

The Sonarqube gem attempts to make the Sonarqube API as object-oriented and Ruby-like as possible. All of the methods and API calls are heavily documented with examples inline using YARD. 
In order to keep the examples versioned with the code, this documentation only lists a few examples for using the Sonarqube gem. Please see the inline documentation for the full API documentation
